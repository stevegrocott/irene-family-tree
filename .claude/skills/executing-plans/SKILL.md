# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan from a file path or a GitHub Issue number, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

**Input sources:**
- **Plan file:** Read from specified file path
- **Issue:** Fetch via `.claude/scripts/platform/read-issue.sh N | jq -r '.body'` and parse the `## Implementation Tasks` section

1. Read plan file or fetch GH issue body
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch
**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report
When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Context Checkpoint (Optional — Token Optimization)

After reporting a batch and before continuing, check whether context has grown large (many file reads, tool calls, or 3+ batches completed). If so:

1. **Save state:** Run `/create-session-summary` to persist progress to `.claude/sessions/`
2. **Suggest to user:** "This session has accumulated significant context. You can run `/clear` to free tokens, then `/resume-session` to continue from where we left off. Or just say 'continue' to keep going."
3. **If user clears:** They will invoke `/resume-session` which will reload this skill at Step 4

**When to suggest:** After the 2nd batch completes, or whenever the session feels heavy. This is optional — skip if the plan is nearly complete or context is manageable.

### Step 4: Continue
Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
